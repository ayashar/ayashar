### 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

As the title said, I'm Ayasha R. (or Aya for short), a second-year Computer Science student at Universitas Gadjah Mada and a front-end developer passionate about building clean and responsive interfaces. I love learning modern tech and exploring ways to bring ideas to life through code.

- 🔭 Currently working with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**
- 💡 Believer in clean code, meaningful projects, and teamwork!
- 🎨 Sometimes I obsess over pixel-perfect layouts (in a good way 😆)
- 💜 Fun fact, a really really big fan of purple and cats 🐱
